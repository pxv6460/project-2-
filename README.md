# Project-2 - Team 2 to Tango

## One Stellar Classification

Machine learning can help us predict the type of a star based on features such as Visual Apparent Magnitude, Distance Between the Star and the Earth, Color Index, and Spectral Type the team explored a Star Dataset and implemented a ML model while building two pipelines: one to preprocess data and one to make predictions. Additionally, team 2 utilized custom formulas to create ‘new features’ and fine tuned the model for greater accuracy.

### Existing features from original dataset:
Vmag – Visual Apparent Magnitude of the Star 
<br> Plx – Distance Between the Star and the Earth 
<br> B-V color index – Hot star B-V close to 0 or negative, cool star has a B-V close to 2.0 
<br> SpType – Spectral type

### New features added by the team:
Temperature
<br> Distance (parsecs)
<br> Distance (light years)
<br> Amag (absolute magnitude) 
<br> Luminosity (Sun=1)
<br> Radius (Sun=1)
<br> Plx (in arcsecs)

### Formulas used to calculate new features:
